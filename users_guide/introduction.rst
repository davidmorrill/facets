Introduction
============

Facets is a package which extends the Python language and system with
interesting new capabilities. Initially, some of these capabilities may seem
trivial, superfluous or even irrelevant. But as you continue on and dig deeper,
you may also find it reshaping your approach to problem solving using Python. In
essence, learning and using Facets has its own *tao*: the tao of *reactive
programming*.

Of course, at this point what *reactive programming* means is undefined, or
perhaps a vague feeling or impression at best. But hopefully as you work your
way through the rest of this introduction and manual, you'll come to understand
and appreciate exactly what this catch phrase signifies.

Like many systems, Facets is based on a small core of key concepts and ideas.
In the case of Facets, the six core ideas can be expressed succinctly:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   tao_validate
   tao_initialize
   tao_delegate
   tao_notify
   tao_visualize
   tao_animate

In the next few sections we'll expound on each of these ideas in more detail.
