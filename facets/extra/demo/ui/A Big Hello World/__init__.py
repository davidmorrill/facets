"""
# A Big Hello World #

Most programming languages or frameworks often start with a simple example of
showing how to display the string: *Hello, world!*. For Facets, we provide not
just one, but several, examples, including:

- The very basics, showing *Hello, world!* in a text field.
- One showing it displayed many times as cells in spreadsheet-like grid.
- Another showing it typed over and over again on a simulated teletype.
