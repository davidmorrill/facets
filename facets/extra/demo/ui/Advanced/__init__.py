# Advanced #

In this section we explore some of the more advanced editors Facets provides.
Some, like the **GridEditor**, provide advanced functionality that is useful in
a wide variety of application settings.

Others, like the **CustomFileDialogEditor**, provide capabilities that you may
not need every day, but which may be very handy when you do.

And then there are others, like the **HLSADerivedImageEditor**, that you may
never need, but which help illustrate how far beyond the basic button and
checkbox editors that Facets can take you...
