# Applications #

In this section we show a number of sample applications built using the Facets
framework with the hope that they will help illustrate how the various pieces
all come together when creating a Facets-based program.

Some of the examples include:

- **Converter**: A simple program for converting feet to inches and other units.
- **Todo mvc**: A Facets implementation of the well-known To Do list MVC-based
  application.
- **Web color picker**: An application for selecting color samples and copying
  them to the system clipboard in one of several standard web-based formats.
- **Python source browser**: A simple Python source code browser using a file
  system selector.
