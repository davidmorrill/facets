# Dynamic Forms #

The demos in this section illustrate techniques you can use to create user
interfaces that dynamically change in response to model or user input changes.
Some of the techniques shown include:

- Enabling and disabling controls in response to value changes.
- Hiding or showing controls in response to value changes.
- Dynamically changing the legal set of enumerated choices for one value when
  other values change.
- Dynamically updating the valid numeric range for one value when other values
  change.
