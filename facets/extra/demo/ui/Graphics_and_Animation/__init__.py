# Graphics and Animation #

Facets includes a powerful, yet easy to use, framework for creating new custom
graphics-based editors, as well as an animation susbsystem that allows animating
any aspect of their behavior.

In this section we explore creating, and often animating, a number of
interesting new, graphics-based editors. There are examples ranging from a few
lines of code illustrating the very basics of using the graphics framework, to
complete mini-applications, such as a simple particle effects generator.
