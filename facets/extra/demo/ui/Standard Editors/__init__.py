# Standard Editors #

The demos in this section illustrate using many of the standard
*bread and butter* editors provided by Facets, including things like:

- Text entry fields
- Buttons
- Checkboxes
- File selectors
- and so on...

For the most part, the demos are not that visually interesting, but do provide a
useful resource for learning how to use their basic meat and potatoes
functionality.
